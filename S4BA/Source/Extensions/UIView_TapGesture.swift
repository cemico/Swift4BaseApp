    // help with readability on our gesture closure
    typealias GestureAction = (() -> Void)?

    // extend UIView with our own custom property with runtime objc calls
    // note: in order to access, i.e. read/write, we need to define a key

    private struct Constants {

        // this is the core piece here for storage - it can be of
        // any type really, from UInt8 to String.  it is the physical
        // address used to extend the system class with a new property.
        // here I give it a string for readability, but could just as
        // easily be defined as:
        //
        // static var tapGestureRecognizer: UInt8 = 0
        //
        // one thing to note, as since this is the physical address being
        // used, in the calls to the objc runtime routines, you *must*
        // use this directly, versus something like this, which will NOT work:
        //
        // var key = Constants.tapGestureRecognizer
        // objc_getAssociatedObject(self, &key)
        //
        // and, finally, it's just an address, so you could also just as easily
        // provide the address outside a "struct", and just define a "var" for it:
        //
        // private var tapGestureRecognizerAddress: UInt8 = 0
        //

        // note: var type versus let because we're writing to this
        static var tapGestureRecognizer = "tapGestureRecognizer"
    }

    // internal computed property to access our new custom property

            return tapGestureRecognizerClosure
        }

        set {

            if let newValue = newValue {

                // write with retain, note: use struct address directly
                objc_setAssociatedObject(self, &Constants.tapGestureRecognizer, newValue, objc_AssociationPolicy.OBJC_ASSOCIATION_RETAIN)
            }
        }

        // tap does no good if no user interaction
